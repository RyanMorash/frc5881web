Participation in FIRST is not only demanding, invigorating and fun, but financially challenging as well. The Dragons are not funded by FIRST or any school, so we depend on the generous support of corporate sponsors, local businesses and private contributions. Our annual fund raising goal is $20,000. Our team is committed to providing a high-quality experience for our students, and **never charging dues or fees to participate**. We rely on the generosity of sponsors to help us cover the costs of registration fees, travel expenses, and materials. This season, we're competing in two events for the first time, but rising costs mean we need your help to make it possible. If you are interested in supporting the Dragons financially, please consider making a donation.
